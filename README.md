**Arkanoid Game in Java**  
This project is a recreation of the classic **Arkanoid** game implemented in Java using the Swing framework. It features:  

- **Game Components**: Includes a paddle, ball, and bricks, with smooth collision detection.  
- **Level Loading**: Levels are dynamically loaded from a text file, allowing customization.  
- **Graphics & Animation**: Utilizes `javax.swing` for rendering and `Timer` for smooth animations at 240 FPS.  
- **Keyboard Controls**: Navigate using arrow keys (`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `DOWN`), and pause/unpause with `ESC`.  

Perfect for learning about 2D game development and Java GUI programming!
